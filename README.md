# PoRTo
## Portative Rig Tools
PoRTo is a personal collection of scripts and tools. This project is a
work in progress and mostly an excuse to experiment things.
  
All scripts are made with the intent of helping with the rigging process,
including setting up preferences and shelves. However, **the tools are set
in a way that may not fit everyone**. PoRTo is developped first and foremost
for my own use, and so it is tailored to my own rigging preferences.
  
The visibility of this repository may alternate between private and public
without notice.
